Title: Learning Project: Dependency Injection in Android with Room and Retrofit Integration

Description:

Embark on a comprehensive learning journey of Dependency Injection (DI) with this project. The implementation, crafted in Kotlin, follows the MVVM architecture with Clean Code principles, further enhanced by the integration of Room and Retrofit for robust data handling.

Key Features:

This project aims to showcase the practical application of DI in Android, utilizing manual Dependency Injection as a starting point. Throughout the learning journey, we demonstrate how to seamlessly inject Room for local data storage and Retrofit for efficient network communication with various DI approaches, including manual DI, Hilt, and Dagger, providing a well-rounded understanding of Dependency Injection in Android development.
